Caution: this should be left empty unless for emergency. 

This file is loaded BEFORE generated.bib (in example.tex) and so any entries here will OVERRIDE any there.  Overriding will lead to a bibtex error "Repeated entry".

If you feel you need to override an entry, it likely means that the generated.bib needs to be regenerated.  Do that instead.

OTOH, if you need to provide a manually curated entry not provided by generated.bib then add it to curated.bib.


If an override is provided in this file, it is responsibility of the human to assure it has all the proper keywords.


With all that said, here is a contrived example to override an entry in the generated.bib file in order to add a keyword that is missing there.   In production, this lack of keyword would be fixed by re-running the workflow with, eg:

  recibi tag -t bv -t edg -T collaboration -o out.bib in.bib

Or via merge of individually tagged bib files.  See edg.org for more.
